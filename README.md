# ExchangeOnPrem_MailFix
Part 1 and 2 is for creating on-prem mailboxes with exchange powershell and setting it up for O365

Part 1 gets the info from the user
Part 2 uses the info from Part 1 to set the correct exchange values

Recommended to run this on a on-prem exchange server with the ExchangeOnline and AzureAD module installed
